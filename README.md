•	Firebase Auth : Manging Accounts/ Loging in and Registrations.

•	Firebase Firestore : Database for the system.

•	Firebase Storage : To store proucts images and user profile pictures.

•	MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.
